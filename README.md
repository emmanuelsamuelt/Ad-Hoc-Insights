# Ad-Hoc-Insights
## Project Overview and Problem Statement:

Atliq Hardware, a prominent computer hardware manufacturer in India with a strong international presence, specializes in selling computers and accessories. The management has recognized a gap in their ability to access timely insights needed for making quick, data-driven decisions. To address this, the Data Analytics Director plans to expand the company's data analytics team by recruiting several junior data analysts.

As part of the recruitment process, the director has designed an SQL challenge to evaluate candidates' technical expertise and soft skills. The company is now seeking insights in response to 10 ad hoc business requests.

## Data set:
The 'gdb023' (atliq_hardware_db) database was provided to me for analysis, and it includes six main tables:

- dim_customer: Stores data related to customers.
- dim_product: Holds product-specific information.
- fact_gross_price: Contains details on the gross price of each product.
- fact_manufacturing_cost: Includes information on production costs for each product.
- fact_pre_invoice_deductions: Tracks deductions applied before invoicing for each product.
- fact_sales_monthly: Records monthly sales data for each product.


## My Task:
My task was to:

- Review the document "ad-hoc-requests.pdf," which included 10 ad hoc business requests that needed insights.
- Write and execute SQL queries to address these requests.
- Create a presentation to showcase the insights, tailored for top-level management.

## My Approach:
**1.Data Extraction using SQL:**
- Employed MySQL to run queries and extract the required data efficiently.

**2.Data Visualization:**
- Used Power BI to create clear and compelling visualizations, making the insights easily understandable.

**3.Presentation Design:**
- Developed a polished and professional presentation in Microsoft PowerPoint to communicate findings effectively.

**4.Actionable Insights:**
- Delivered actionable insights and recommendations to help the management team make informed decisions.

## Outcome:
In this project, I showcased my ability to manage complex data queries and present insights in a clear and engaging way. This experience not only sharpened my technical skills but also improved my ability to effectively communicate data-driven insights.

## Repository Contents:

- Ad-hoc-requests.pdf: A document listing 10 ad hoc business requests.
- SQL Queries: A folder with SQL scripts for data extraction.
- Power BI Visualizations: A folder containing Power BI files with various data visualizations.
- Presentation: A file that highlights insights and recommendations.
